# Handwritten Digits Prediction ðŸš€

Handwritten Digits Classifier ðŸ¤–
This is a machine learning model that predicts handwritten digits (0-9) with an impressive 99% accuracy. Built using TensorFlow/Keras, the model is trained on the MNIST dataset and can be run directly in a Jupyter notebook.

Features ðŸš€

âœ… 99% Accuracy: Achieves high accuracy in classifying handwritten digits from 0 to 9 using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

âœ… No Additional Setup: The model runs entirely within the notebook with no need for external tools or web interfaces.

âœ… Fully Trained Model: Uses the MNIST dataset for training and is ready to predict handwritten digits in real time.

âœ… Easy to Use: Simply input an image of a handwritten digit and get an immediate prediction.
